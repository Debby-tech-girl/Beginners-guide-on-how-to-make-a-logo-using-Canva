## BEGINNERS GUIDE ON HOW TO MAKE A LOGO USING CANVA.

Designing a logo is an important aspect of a brand’s identity and there are a lot of useful tools that can be used to accomplish that.

For the sake of this study, we’ll be focusing more on Canva which is a cloud based graphic design tool used to create on-brand marketing content, sales presentations, training videos and more by companies of all sizes. 

Canva has beautifully designed templates, millions of photos, icons and illustrations which makes it easy to create and customize a logo.

Having established the fact that a logo is your brand’s identity, there are a lot that needs to be considered/carried out before designing a logo and they are listed below:

1.Research
2.Finding inspiration (visual inspiration)
3.Keeping it simple
4.Choosing the appropriate color

#### 1.RESEARCH.

When creating a design from scratch, research is important and comes in handy because you need to understand the brand, what it stands for, its potential audience (client), e.t.c. This step helps to determine how the other steps will be carried out. 



#### 2.FINDING INSPIRATION (VISUAL INSPIRATION).

Inspiration is everywhere, but you need the right type of inspiration to help you create a good logo. You can search for the visual representation of key words and phrases, play around with them until you find the right inspiration for your design. 

#### 3.KEEPING IT SIMPLE.

It is always advisable to keep your design simple, this does not mean you should refrain from expressing yourself but then don’t forget the goal and desired effect your logo is meant to have.

Bogus designs might be difficult to understand the message behind it or to read meaning into it depending on your target audience, which is why a simple design is always advisable.

#### 4.CHOOSING THE APPROPRIATE COLOR.

It is worthy to note that different colors have different meanings. Always go for colors that match the meaning of your logo and pass across the message it’s meant to pass across.

When the meaning of your logo has been established, it is good to choose a color that matches its aura and grabs the attention of the audience.
